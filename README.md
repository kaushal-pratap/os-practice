# os-practice
This repository is my playground for OS. All my journey from learning to building is shared here. There will be a separate official repository for OS creation. 
I'm starting with Linux as base system and then will playaround with it to learn. 

**How is my OS different?**
*Maximum customization, more than any OS out there*
*Can run maximum or popular windows apps seamlessly. Integrate wine in background and make the apps feel native*
*Will have all the features that a windows have*
*Softwares will be downloaded during the install are on the preferences as programmer, student, office employee, etc*
*Full Focus on Privacy and Security. Shows which app is using which hardware. Do sandboxing anf isolation to stop third party apps to collect data*
*No bloatware / Fully Custonmizable / lightweight / beautiful and aesthetic / Privacy and security focused / run windows apps like they're native*

I'll be sharing all the files and documentation here on github.
